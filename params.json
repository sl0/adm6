{"name":"adm6","tagline":"adm6 generates ipv6 filtercommands as you like them","body":"# *adm6* - generate your ip6 filters \r\n\r\n### simplicity as main concept\r\n### convert a ruleset to filtercommands for many machines\r\n### python for the best readability of the sources\r\n### GNU general public license version 3 or newer\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## *adm6* status - 2013-03-29\r\n\r\nIt's still growing. Tests status is ok for now, nearly 100% of the sources are covered. \r\nOf course, this does not mean, they're without any faults, but we're never sure about that. \r\nNext goals are to have some useful documentation:\r\n\r\n1. Description of possible configuration items and their meanings.\r\n2. Description of the rules syntax and options\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## *adm6* where it comes from\r\n\r\nIntentionally it was developed for getting a deeper knowledge by doing and \r\na more secure IPv6 networking. First ideas came up, because there was some \r\nknowhow about IPv4 and howto filter these packets for better bandwith usage \r\nand a more secure way of communications. \r\n*Simple security policy editor* (http://sspe.sourceforge.net) gives an example\r\nof a framework, which may be useful to build shell-scripts using iptables \r\nfor many machines running linux OS. It was written in perl and shell for a \r\nlinux driven enterprise. Main advantage is a single set of rules for \r\nthe packetfiltering hosts alltogether.\r\nAs the concepts of sspe are working well since 2002 until now, \r\nadm6 applies them to IPv6 except of the IPv4 specific NAT difficulties.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## *adm6* how it was started into the public\r\n\r\nAfter a first look into the python universe and after there was a /48 delivered\r\non a leased line, I started to write some plain python files. One of my friends\r\nrecommended me to put them into a repository, write some explanations and to\r\ndeposit these on a public place. First choice was http://evolvis.org because of\r\na friendship to one of their maintainers. \r\n\r\nAt some conferences *adm6* was presented:\r\n\r\n. LinuxTag 2011, Berlin\r\n\r\n. Heise IPv6 Conference, 2011, Frankfurt\r\n\r\n. OpenRheinRuhr 2011, Oberhausen\r\n\r\n. Secure Linux Administrators Conference 2011, Berlin\r\n\r\n. BGNW Fr체hjahrstagung 2012, Berlin\r\n\r\n. GUUG e.V. Fr체hjahrsfachgespr채ch 2012, M체nchen\r\n\r\n. OpenSource-Forum 2012, CeBIT Hannover\r\n\r\nPeople listened, asked a few questions. So I knew my software to\r\nbe somehow strange but kept on going ...\r\n\r\nSome other small python projects came across my way ... I learned about\r\ntesting python code using nose, and now I'm conviced, every non fully \r\ntested software is broken by design. So I started to write tests, because \r\nI always wanted it to become a stable and reliable product. \r\nI took it file by file, wrote the tests and put the results onto my github \r\nprofile. There it is.\r\n\r\nThe old version of adm6 is kept available at http://evolvis.org/projects/adm6\r\nwhich has a german description only and no tests at all, sorry.\r\n\r\nHave fun!\r\n\r\nsl0\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
