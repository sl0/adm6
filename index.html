<em>adm6</em> - generate your ip6 filters</h1>

<h4>simplicity as main concept</h4>
<h4>convert a ruleset to filtercommands for many machines</h4>
<h4>python for the best readability of the sources</h4>
<h4>GNU general public license version 3 or newer</h4>

<hr><h3>
<em>adm6</em> status - 2013-04-03 - Version 0.2.0</h3>
<p>sphinx-docs added, covering main aspects of configuration
and whats about setting up a nice demonstration scene. Just do:
</p>
<code>
	git clone https://github.com/sl0/adm6
	cd adm6
	cd doc
	make html
</code>
<p>Perhaps then you light like to point your browser to doc/build/html/index.html
</p>

<hr><h3>
<em>adm6</em> status - 2013-03-29</h3>

<p>It's still growing. Tests status is ok for now, nearly 100% of the sources are covered. 
Of course, this does not mean, they're without any faults, but we're never sure about that. 
Next goals are to have some useful documentation:</p>

<ol>
<li>Description of possible configuration items and their meanings.</li>
<li>Description of the rules syntax and options</li>
</ol><hr><h3>
<em>adm6</em> where it comes from</h3>

<p>Intentionally it was developed for getting a deeper knowledge by doing and 
a more secure IPv6 networking. First ideas came up, because there was some 
knowhow about IPv4 and howto filter these packets for better bandwith usage 
and a more secure way of communications. 
<em>Simple security policy editor</em> (<a href="http://sspe.sourceforge.net">http://sspe.sourceforge.net</a>) gives an example
of a framework, which may be useful to build shell-scripts using iptables 
for many machines running linux OS. It was written in perl and shell for a 
linux driven enterprise. Main advantage is a single set of rules for 
the packetfiltering hosts alltogether.
As the concepts of sspe are working well since 2002 until now, 
adm6 applies them to IPv6 except of the IPv4 specific NAT difficulties.</p>

<hr><h2>
<em>adm6</em> how it was started into the public</h2>

<p>After a first look into the python universe and after there was a /48 delivered
on a leased line, I started to write some plain python files. One of my friends
recommended me to put them into a repository, write some explanations and to
deposit these on a public place. First choice was <a href="http://evolvis.org">http://evolvis.org</a> because of
a friendship to one of their maintainers. </p>

<p>At some conferences <em>adm6</em> was presented:</p>

<p>. LinuxTag 2011, Berlin</p>

<p>. Heise IPv6 Conference, 2011, Frankfurt</p>

<p>. OpenRheinRuhr 2011, Oberhausen</p>

<p>. Secure Linux Administrators Conference 2011, Berlin</p>

<p>. BGNW Fr체hjahrstagung 2012, Berlin</p>

<p>. GUUG e.V. Fr체hjahrsfachgespr채ch 2012, M체nchen</p>

<p>. OpenSource-Forum 2012, CeBIT Hannover</p>

<p>People listened, asked a few questions. So I knew my software to
be somehow strange but kept on going ...</p>

<p>Some other small python projects came across my way ... I learned about
testing python code using nose, and now I'm conviced, every non fully 
tested software is broken by design. So I started to write tests, because 
I always wanted it to become a stable and reliable product. 
I took it file by file, wrote the tests and put the results onto my github 
profile. There it is.</p>

<p>The old version of adm6 is kept available at <a href="http://evolvis.org/projects/adm6">http://evolvis.org/projects/adm6</a>
which has a german description only and no tests at all, sorry.</p>

<p>Have fun!</p>
